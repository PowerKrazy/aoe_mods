Attempting to make the ocean more worthwhile with resources and sea fortresses and less random with lairs instead of galleys coming from the fog of war.

For: WorldofErebus, Erebus Continent, Perfect World

Ocean and deep ocean trade moved from Astronomy to Optics.

Turned off random barbarian ship spawns; random animals still permitted.

Added pirate strongholds and drown lairs that pump out hostile ships and demons.

Added deep-sea fortresses to conquer for powerful empire-wide resource bonuses to be claimed and defended from other civilizations.

Added special unit promotions available to those who have claimed these sea forts.

Added Coral Reef resource (more to come).

Allowed most Sea resources in Deep Sea(i can see this being either loved or hated).

Also lowered some special sea resources spawn rates to compinsate for how big the sea is now.
=============================================
Intended Balance - If you feel that any changes do no fit the intended balance, or feel that the intended balance is wrong and the dev should feel bad, feel free to yell at me on the Ashes of Erebus Discord:

Pirates come from fixed coastal lairs, applying pressure that fades as civs colonize available coastlines and islands, pushing them to the edges of the world. Lair can be walked onto by land units.

Drowns apply soft pressure to coastlines and workers by the shorelines. become Stygian Guards at Malevolent Designs.

Ocean Forts give regional and trade route control; on top of that, they provide powerful late-game boosts to a nation's research/production/commerce as well as promotions to give their owners a further edge. As forts, they can be taken away by other civs during war.

The intended number of forts is about 4-5 for each kind (currently 3 types), if you or loved ones have been a victim of way too many sea forts, please call the emergency helpline 1.800.OhShitAKraken.

Ocean Forts are intended to be medium-medium hard difficulty; they do not respawn, and all monsters are leashed. By the endgame, the only danger on the seas should be other Civs and hero units (Leviathan).

Trade routes become available at optics, the final tier of research (astronomy), is reserved for seeking greater naval strength.
